00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.910
Ladies and Gentlemen,
well, Gentlemen certainly.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.330
This is no place for a lady.
[laughter]

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.050
It gives me great pleasure,
and no small amount of relief,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.019
to declare this, the first ever flushing public
lavatory, open.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.599
[applause]

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.599

[whistling]

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:37.599
You might want to leave it five minutes.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
Oh, oh my goodness
[other sounds of disgust]

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:55.000
A year previously, in 1851, temporary toilets
were exhibited at the Great Exhibition in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.030
London's Hyde Park and visitors were charged
a penny to use them

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.359
and that is thought to be the origin of the
phrase "to spend a penny"

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.280
And this is the origin of the Nobel Peace
Prize

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.280
>> Alfred: hmph, interesting that that is not what is
supposed to happen...

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.360
>> Sophie: Darling I don't want to worry you or anything,
but I think you might be dead!.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.130
>> Alfred: hmph, I don't think so darling.
>> Sophie: Well this newspaper seems to think you are

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.130
and it's always been very reliable in the
past.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
Look Dr. Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist
and inventor of dynamite

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.710
died yesterday in the French resort of Cannes.
>> Alfred: Let me see that.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.409
Good grief, it does say I'm dead.
Look what they're calling me here,

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.759
the merchant of death, it says here Dr. Alfred
Nobel became rich by finding ways to kill

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.689
more people even faster than ever before.
Honestly, by reading this you'd think that

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.280
just because I invented dynamite I am personally
responsible for the death of thousands of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.610
people.
I mean honestly.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.399
Have you ever heard such nonsense?
I said, have you ever heard such rubbish?

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.399
Sophie, if you have something to say...
>> Sophie: Well, you did invent what is at this point

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.270
in time the most powerful explosive on earth
and it has gone on to kill thousands and thousands

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.000
of people.
>> Alfred: What's your point?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.720
All I'm saying is that when people hear the
word Nobel people they are always going to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.280
think of dynamite.
>> Alfred: I knew I should have called it Nobel's safety

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.650
powder.
I mean do you really think that when I actually

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.580
do go this is how I'll be remembered?
>> Sophie: Oh, sweet heart, of course it is, my fairy-cheeked

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.690
little death merchant.
>> Alfred: Well not if I can help it.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.550
I shall reinvent my own image.
I shall use my massive fortune to establish

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.670
a special prize.
One that rewards positive human endeavors

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.340
in the pursuit of peace.
So when I do die, I won't just be linked to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.560
explosives.
And I, Alfred Nobel

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.560
will call this special peace prize, prize-o-mite
>> Sophie: Darling, why don't you call it the Nobel Peace

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.940
Prize?
[laughter]

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.940
>> Alfred: I love you darling, but you have absolutely
no idea when it comes to marketing.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.090
Tea!
>> Sophie: Certainly...
